Traffic signal coordination and accident detection:
Congestion on sequential intersections remains a huge issue because traditional traffic signal systems don't look for
congestion in further junctions in making decisions for changing their timers. Fixed timer systems mostly bring
about extra wait times, delay in traveling, and urban traffic inefficiencies.An adaptable density driven traffic control
scheme that automatically re-tunes its signal timing relative to the momentary flow condition is introduced here. By
allowing signals at a given intersection to discharge vehicles only after adequate clearance at the subsequent one,
the system reduces congestion and optimizes travel. Moreover, accident detection and sensor-based monitoring
facilitate enhanced real-time responsiveness. Sensors provide accurate traffic flow information, enabling rapid
incident detection and adaptive signal adjustment. In case of an accident, the system automatically modifies signals
to divert traffic and minimize delays.Simulation results show that this method efficiently minimizes congestion,
maximizes traffic flow, and improves urban mobility. By increasing the adaptability and intelligence of road
networks, the system substantially enhances overall traffic management
